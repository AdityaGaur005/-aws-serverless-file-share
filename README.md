# Serverless File Sharing with AWS

A simple, secure, and scalable serverless web application for uploading and sharing files using AWS services. This project showcases how to use AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 together with a React frontend to build a modern file-sharing platform without any backend servers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Serverless architecture:** No backend servers, fully managed AWS services
- **Secure file upload:** Upload files directly from the browser using presigned S3 URLs generated by Lambda
- **On-demand download URLs:** Generate secure, time-limited download links via Lambda
- **Simple React frontend:** User-friendly drag & drop or file browsing interface
- **AWS API Gateway:** HTTP API endpoints connecting frontend to Lambda functions
- **Scalable & cost-effective:** Only pay for what you use with AWS managed services

## 📝 Setup & Deployment Instructions

### 1. AWS S3 Bucket

- Create a bucket to store uploaded files.
- Inside the bucket, create a folder named `uploads/`.
- Configure **Bucket Policy** and **CORS**:
  
  **Bucket Policy** (allow your Lambda functions appropriate S3 access):
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowLambdaAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::filesharing-thisside/*"
        }
    ]

}


**CORS Configuration**:
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT",
            "POST"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "ETag"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]




### 2. AWS Lambda Functions

- Deploy two Lambda functions:
- `generate_upload_url.py` — generates presigned upload URLs
- `generate_download_url.py` — generates presigned download URLs
- Grant Lambda's execution role permission to access S3 `uploads/` folder (`s3:PutObject` and `s3:GetObject`).

### 3. AWS API Gateway

- Create an HTTP API.
- Add two POST routes:
- `/uploads` → linked to `generate_upload_url` Lambda
- `/download` → linked to `generate_download_url` Lambda
- Enable CORS on both routes (allow your frontend’s origin or use `*` for development).

### 4. Frontend

- Host your React frontend (`index.html`) on static web hosting (e.g., S3 website hosting, Netlify, Vercel).
- Make sure to update the API endpoint URLs in the frontend code with your API Gateway invoke URLs.

---

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Open the frontend URL (hosted on S3 or your chosen hosting).
2. Drag and drop or browse to select a file.
3. Click **Upload File**.
4. The file is uploaded securely to S3 via a presigned URL generated by Lambda.
5. On success, a secure download URL is generated and presented.
6. Clicking the link downloads the file from S3 using a time-limited presigned URL.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

- The app uses presigned URLs to allow direct browser uploads to S3 without exposing AWS credentials.
- CORS must be correctly configured on both AWS S3 bucket and API Gateway.
- This setup is ideal for serverless, cost-effective file sharing without managing servers.
- You can extend this by adding authentication, database logging (e.g., DynamoDB), analytics, or notifications.
